Scalable Go Microservice with Hot Reloading, gRPC, RabbitMQ, Docker, MongoDB, Jaeger, Consul & Stripe

Highly Scalable and Maintainable Golang Microservice Architecture

This project implements a robust microservice architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and resilience. It leverages modern technologies to facilitate rapid development, efficient communication, and reliable data management.

Key Features:

Modern Go 1.22: Utilizes the latest Go language features for performance and maintainability. Hot Reloading (cosmtrek/air): Enables rapid development iterations without service restarts. gRPC Communication: Provides high-performance inter-service communication. RabbitMQ Message Broker: Ensures asynchronous message delivery and decoupling for fault tolerance. Docker & Docker Compose: Simplifies deployment, scaling, and environment consistency. MongoDB Storage: Offers a flexible NoSQL solution for document-oriented data. Jaeger Service Tracing: Provides comprehensive insights into service calls and performance metrics. HashiCorp Consul Service Discovery: Enables dynamic service registration and discovery. Stripe Payment Integration: (Optional) Streamlines secure payment processing. Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Go 1.22, Docker, and Docker Compose installed. Clone the Repository: Run git clone https://<your_repository_url> to clone this project. Build and Run: Navigate to the project directory and run docker-compose up -d to build and start all services. API Documentation: (Optional) Refer to the docs directory for API documentation if applicable. Development:

Code resides in the src directory. Unit and integration tests are encouraged for robust quality assurance. Additional Considerations:

Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for service resilience. Define an authentication and authorization strategy for secure access. Establish monitoring and alerting for proactive issue identification. Utilize version control (Git) and CI/CD pipelines for streamlined development and deployment. Consider Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform for managing infrastructure configurations. Customization:

This architecture can be adapted to your specific needs. Refer to the code and configuration files for customization options.
